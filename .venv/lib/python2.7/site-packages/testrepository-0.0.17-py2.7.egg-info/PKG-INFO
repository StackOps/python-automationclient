Description: Test Repository
        +++++++++++++++
        
        Overview
        ~~~~~~~~
        
        This project provides a database of test results which can be used as part of
        developer workflow to ensure/check things like:
        
        * No commits without having had a test failure, test fixed cycle.
        * No commits without new tests being added.
        * What tests have failed since the last commit (to run just a subset).
        * What tests are currently failing and need work.
        
        Test results are inserted using subunit (and thus anything that can output
        subunit or be converted into a subunit stream can be accepted).
        
        A mailing list for discussion, usage and development is at
        https://launchpad.net/~testrepository-dev - all are welcome to join. Some folk
        hang out on #testrepository on irc.freenode.net.
        
        CI for the project is at http://build.robertcollins.net/job/testrepository-default/.
