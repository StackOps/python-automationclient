"""Fixtures provides a sensible contract for reusable test fixtures.

It also provides glue for using these in common test runners and acts as a
common repository for widely used Fixture classes.

See the README for a manual, and the docstrings on individual functions and
methods for details.

Most users will want to look at TestWithFixtures and Fixture, to start with.

# same format as sys.version_info: "A tuple containing the five components of
# the version number: major, minor, micro, releaselevel, and serial. All
# values except releaselevel are integers; the release level is 'alpha',
# 'beta', 'candidate', or 'final'. The version_info value corresponding to the
# Python version 2.0 is (2, 0, 0, 'final', 0)."  Additionally we use a
# releaselevel of 'dev' for unreleased under-development code.
#
# If the releaselevel is 'alpha' then the major/minor/micro components are not
# established at this point, and setup.py will use a version of next-$(revno).
# If the releaselevel is 'final', then the tarball will be major.minor.micro.
# Otherwise it is major.minor.micro~$(revno).
