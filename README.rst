Python bindings to the Stackops Automation API
==============================================

This is a client for the Stackops Automation API. There's a Python API (the
``automationclient`` module), and a command-line script (``automation``). Each
implements 100% of the Stackops Automation API.

See the `Stackops Automation CLI guide`_ for information on how to use the ``automation``
command-line tool. You may also want to look at the
`Stackops Automation API documentation`_.

.. _Stackops Automation CLI guide: http://automationclient.stackops.org/
.. _Stackops Automation API documentation: http://docs.stackops.org/display/STACKOPSAUTOMATION/StackOps+Automation

The code is hosted on `Github`_.

.. _Github: https://github.com/StackOps/python-automationclient

This code is based on `Openstack python-cinderclient`__ If you need API support
for the Openstack Cinder API solely or the Apache license, you should use that repository.

Latest release version
----------------------

The latest release version of Stackops python-automationclient is ``v1.2.1``
that correspond with the current release of ``Stackops automation package``
who has the same number version as well.

Important Installation for development purpose (Temporal)
---------------------------------------------------------
Stackops python-automationclient is under development taking as groundwork the project
Openstack python-cinderclient, therefore to recreate the current project you need to clone this one
throught the command ``git clone https://github.com/StackOps/python-automationclient`` and then follow the
next steps:

1. Go to the directory ``python-automationclient``
2. Once on the directory run the command ``python tools/install_venv.py`` to create a virtual environment
   to work on it
3. Activate the virtual environment with the command ``source .venv/bin/activate``
4. Install the python-automationclient throught the command ``python setup.py install``
5. This is all!! Start to contribute....


Command-line API
----------------
Installing this package gets you a shell command, ``automation``, that you
can use to interact with any Stackops Automation compatible API..

You'll need to provide your Stackops Automation username, password and tenant_name.
You can do this with the ``--os-username``, ``--os-password`` and  ``--os-tenant-name``
params, but it's easier to just set them as environment variables::

    export OS_USERNAME=stackops
    export OS_PASSWORD=secret
    export OS_TENANT_NAME=service

You will also need to define the authentication url with ``--os-auth-url``
and the version of the API with ``--version``.  Or set them as an environment
variables as well::

    export OS_AUTH_URL=http://example.com:5000/v2.0/
    export OS_VERSION=1

As Stackops Automation used Keystone, you need to set the AUTOMATION_URL to the keystone
endpoint::

    export OS_AUTH_URL=http://example.com:5000/v2.0/

Since Keystone can return multiple regions in the Service Catalog, you
can specify the one you want with ``--os-region-name`` (or
``export OS_REGION_NAME``). It defaults to the first in the list returned.

You'll find complete documentation on the shell by running
``automation help``::

    usage: automation [--version] [--debug] [--os-username <auth-user-name>]
                  [--os-password <auth-password>]
